## Pilot results

A pilot study with five subjects is performed. 

The graph below shows muscle activation profiles for normal (first row) and perturbed walking (second row) for three muscles, tibialis anterior, lateral gastrocnemius and medial gastrocnemius.

The folloowing graph compares muscle activation profiles during steady-state conditions to those from transient responses. We observe some qualitative similarities between the two types of responses. At the same regions during the gait cycle we see increase in inhibition (black arrows). Particularly for plantarflexors this happens around the push-off phase. There is also some decrease in inhibition in transient profiles before push-off. However due to limited statistical power (5 subjects) it is not clear how reliable this observation is and if the same decrease in inhibition exists in steady-state condition.
