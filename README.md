# Visual stimulation, speed and plantarflexors activities (VSP)

The VSP project studies how muscle activation profiles change as a function of speed at different phases of gait cycle and investigates the differences between steady-state and transient profiles. An important part of this investigation is to establish a method to quantify shapes of muscle activations as a function of phase in order to compare changes across different conditions.
